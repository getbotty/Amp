## TODO Items for AMP

1. Fix the checkboxes and button groups.
2. Fix the display of tags in tag-lists. Broken in FF and windows.
5. Test the list's ajax functionality.
6. Think about adding "enableOn"
7. Add boolean controls to the grid
8. Bug with datepicker. Alt-tab while datepicker is focused. When you alt-tab back, the input is not focused but the datepicker is shown.
9. Implement anyValue for Combo, where the combo behaves like a normal text input.
10. Implement Optgroups/Nested items for all lists.
11. Make a mobile version.
12. When a grid editable input is defocused buy clicking elsewhere on the page, it will call __editStart on the next editable field - if the caret was at the end of the defocused field. This should happen only when defocusing by pressing the arrow keys.
